# GZ Curve – Polygon Method

This repository contains a polygon-based method to compute the ship GZ curve directly from offset data.

## Overview
- Sectional geometry constructed using offset tables
- KN computed via longitudinal integration
- GZ curve generated for multiple heel angles

## How to run
```bash
python3 main.py

When prompted, enter:
- Ship draft (m)
- KG (m)
